    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a dedicated fourth-year college student with a strong passion for system design, software development, and innovative hardware-software integration. My expertise includes working with microcontrollers, developing graphical user interfaces, and building automation systems. I thrive on solving real-world challenges through technology and continuously expand my knowledge by engaging in hands-on projects.</p>
    <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I am committed to leveraging my skills through freelance opportunities to support my education. I am confident in my ability to contribute to both comprehensive software solutions and hardware-based projects, including platforms such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I believe that true learning comes from practical experience, and I am eager to embrace new challenges that will foster my growth as both a developer and a problem solver.</p>
